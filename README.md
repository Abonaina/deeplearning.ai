The notes ~~and answers~~ of Adrew Ng's coursera course: deeplearning.ai 

If you want to download the slides and the notebooks please check [shahariarrabby/deeplearning.ai](https://github.com/shahariarrabby/deeplearning.ai) In my github, I add some notes while I complete the specifications.





<!--The first three courses may include some error, please let me know if you have problems, I will help you to fix it. -->Email is the fast way to contract with me. You can also open an "ISSUE" from the github. (你可以通过开启ISSUE或者直接邮件联系我，邮件24小时都会回复) The assignment of the course changes very much. So I decide not update the notebook any more. Please go to the official website to get the notebooks. 


If you want to learn basic concept and pratice programme skills about machine learning, you can also try my [github folder](https://github.com/XingxingHuang/Machine_Learning_Projects/machine_learning_algorithms_python). It includes the python implementations of the basic machine learning programs. It helps a lot if you implement all basic algorithms by yourself.

* 中国国内的网易平台已经公开了这个课程的视频，但是没有项目的代码。我想将所有的代码和数据都保存下来。 ~~但是网站上的.h5文件我现在无法完全下载下来，如果知道下载方法，麻烦email给我~~ (感谢YuanZhang提供下载方法)。
